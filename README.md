- Booleans -> true or false

# Data structures
- allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.
  # List
  - contains any data type
  - length function used to determine the length of the list
  ``` bash
  mylist = [ 1, 'list', true, []]

  len(mylist)
  ```

  # Set

  - declared using curly braces
  - orde of elements not important
  ``` bash
  mylist = { 1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

  # Tuples
  - similar to list, but cannot be modified once declared.
  - useful when storing large amount of data
