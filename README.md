# Variables and Types
- variable is the basic unit of a program
- integers -> whole numbers
- floats -> decimal numbers
- complex numbers
- strings -> collection of characters, plus "+" used to concatenate strings.
- Booleans -> true or false

# Data structures
- allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.
  # List
  - contains any data type
  - length function used to determine the length of the list
  ``` bash
  mylist = [ 1, 'list', true, []]

  len(mylist)
  ```

  # Set
  - Similar to list but only contains unique elements
  - declared using curly braces
  - orde of elements not important
  ``` bash
  mylist = { 1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

  # Tuples
  - similar to list, but cannot be modified once declared.
  - useful when storing large amount of data

  # Dictionary
  - is a collection of key-value pairs.
  - declared using curly braces
  - accessed using keys

# Operators
- are instructions that perform operations on variables and values
  # Arithmetic
  - Addition (+), Multiplication (*), Division (/) *returns float*, modulus or Remainder (%)
  # comparison
  - evaluates two variables or values and returns a boolean
  # Logical
  - "and" , "or" , "not"
